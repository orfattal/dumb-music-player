## Project Structure

```

```

## Data Structure

Each song in `data.json` has:
```json
{
  "display_name": "Song Title as it appears on YouTube",
  "filename": "song-file.mp3",
  "youtube_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",
  "thumbnail": "video_id.jpg"
}
```

No search terms are stored - only the final song information.

## YouTube Authentication (Optional)

The app will attempt to download YouTube videos without authentication first, which works for most public videos. However, some videos may require authentication.

**If downloads fail**, you can provide YouTube cookies:

**Option 1: Export cookies manually (Recommended for production)**
1. Install a browser extension like "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" for Chrome/Firefox
2. Visit youtube.com and make sure you're logged in
3. Click the extension and export cookies
4. Save as `cookies.txt` in the project root directory

**Option 2: Use browser cookies (automatic - Local development only)**
On your local machine with Chrome installed, the app will try to use cookies from your Chrome browser automatically.

**Download Strategy**:
The app tries multiple strategies in order:
1. cookies.txt file (if exists)
2. Chrome browser cookies (if Chrome is installed)
3. No authentication (works for most public videos)

## Notes

- **Hebrew Interface**: All UI text is in Hebrew with RTL support for optimal viewing on Nokia 215
- **Opera Mini Optimization**: The UI uses minimal CSS, minimal JavaScript, and simple HTML that works well on feature phones
- **YouTube Downloads**: Uses yt-dlp to search and download from YouTube. Make sure this complies with YouTube's Terms of Service in your jurisdiction
- **Storage**: MP3 files are stored in the `downloads/` directory. Make sure you have enough disk space
- **Song Names**: Songs are initially named as they appear on YouTube, but can be edited through the admin interface
